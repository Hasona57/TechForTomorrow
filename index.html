        <h2>What is the main sections for tech nowdays</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development- this can be front-end or back-end</li>
            <li>Robotics- here where the code change to real robot or sensor that can detect and send orders</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence- where the code change to a resimble for the human that you can ask him for help</li>
            <li>CyberSecurity- where the coding can help to keep your company sites secure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Web development</h2>
        <h3>What is the web development</h3>
        <p>web development is to make codes that are reflected on a site that you can see for real and work on it and change a lot of thing in it.Web development consists of two items to make a website</p>
        <h3>What is the front-end in the web development</h3>
        <p>Front-end is to make the static page that appear for the user the page that you use everyday on google or youtube. those are the page but without any motion the static only</p>
        <h3>What is the back-end in the web development</h3>
        <p>back-end is to make the dynamics in the site to make it interactable when the user make something it is give something change the page a message pop up any of these</p>
        <h3>now how can we learn web development</h3>
        <p>there are many ways but the simplest one is to search on google for sites that help you first step by step to learn basic web development. You can search for videos on youtube</p>

        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <h3>What is Robotics</h3>
        <p>when you see a toy car that move with a remote control you may be thinking how is it working. yes it is robotics to communicate is using a signals between the main board and the remote when the board take signal to move forward it will move and so on</p>
        <h3>Where you can learn?</h3>
        <p>basicly I think that the best site was last minute engneering as it help you understand more about each microcontroller then it start dealing with sensors and do not forget to test your project on wokwi simulator</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <h3>What is the Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>basicly it is the learning of the machien to make machien learn understand something and make predic and try to resimple a human in his way of thinking</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>CyberSecurity</h2>
        <h3>What is the CyberSecurity</h3>
        <p>When you are seeing on the internet that an online bank someone get access on this is called hacking where there are many types but the one who is legal is to work with a company and search for its problems in the site and try to get over it and solve it that is the ethical and legal way to work with it. for me I do not know a lot about but you can search</p>
